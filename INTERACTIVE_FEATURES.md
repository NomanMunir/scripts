# 🎯 Interactive Software Selection - Major Improvement

## Problem Solved

Previously, users had to go through each software component one by one, answering "Do you want to install this component? [Y/n]" for every single item. This was:

- ❌ Time-consuming and tedious
- ❌ Difficult to see all available options at once
- ❌ No way to make bulk selections
- ❌ Hard to navigate and change your mind

## New Solution: Interactive Checkbox Interface

### 🆕 What's New

The new interactive system provides a modern, checkbox-style CLI interface that allows you to:

✅ **See all software at once** - Complete catalog with descriptions
✅ **Multiple selections** - Select as many or as few as you want
✅ **Category filtering** - Filter by development, browsers, databases, etc.
✅ **Intuitive navigation** - Vim-style (j/k) or arrow keys
✅ **Bulk operations** - Select all or none with single keypress
✅ **Real-time feedback** - See selection count and current choice
✅ **Easy modifications** - Toggle selections before confirming

### 🎮 How It Works

1. **Launch**: Run `sudo ./setup-dev.sh` and choose the interactive option
2. **Navigate**: Use ↑/↓ or j/k to move through the software list
3. **Select**: Press Space to toggle checkboxes (✓/✗)
4. **Filter**: Press 'c' to filter by category (development, browsers, etc.)
5. **Bulk Actions**: Press 'a' to select all, 'n' to select none
6. **Confirm**: Press Enter to proceed with your selections
